# Leetqual

A Leetcode-inspired PhD mathematics qualifying exam database written using the Django web framework.

## Goals
The project was mostly intended as an educational tool for me to learn Django and backend web development. Maybe some graduate students will be able to use site to practice exam questions.

The website currently supports question tags, search, and random questions. A tag cloud helps filter questions that the user is interested in.

I hope to eventually add more user functionality and a comment system. I'd like for users to be able to add and modify questions, provide hints, and rate the questions.
